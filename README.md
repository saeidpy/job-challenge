# Engineering Challenges

To revolutionize the food-service industry and make healthy food affordable, we need to have a high-performance engineering team. Every new team member must have the capability to have a significant impact on our codebase and our company.

We believe that the true results of excellent engineering take weeks and months to play out. Success comes from continuously making great decisions. This means that a small challenge will never be a perfect measure of your skills, but it does reveal enough information to be useful. Our goal with coding challenges is to strike the right balance between practical and exciting, so hopefully, that's the experience you'll have.

## What we're looking for

Here's what we generally look for in a project and why we care about it. These are not in priority order.

### `Code Quality`

Writing maintainable code is a skill that becomes increasingly important as the team and the codebase grows. We put a premium
on well organized pull requests that: separate atomic changes into their own commits with descriptive commit messages, and include a PR description that explains your intent, with screenshots/videos of the feature in action.

### `User Experience`

We care about building amazing products. While you'll have the support of designers here, we want to hire people who have a great product sense and care deeply about the customer experience.

### `System Design`

We're looking for people who can make smart, thoughtful choices about how systems should work. Does the app fail gracefully? Can you
identify areas that could become bottlenecks when the system is under heavy load?

### `Speed`

We're looking for people that can balance writing great code with getting things done.

## Choose Your Adventure
